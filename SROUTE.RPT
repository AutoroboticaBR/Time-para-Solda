*****************************************************************


    The synopsis below summarizes the parameters to be used during
autorouting and projects the expected results.  Prior to starting the
Neural autorouter, examine the synopsis to insure the results are as
expected.
    If satisfied with the projections, proceed into autorouting.  If
NOT statisfied, use PARAMETERS in the OPTIONS menu to enter the desired
parameters or else exit the router and change the host database.


1.  LAYERS: The 1 layers will be routed as follows:
             BOTTOM         :  Vertical

2.  CONNECTIONS: There are 12 nets with 25 connections to be routed.

3.  POWER NETS: There are 0 power net(s) to be routed:
                There are 0 power net(s) to be fanned out:

5.  CORNERS:  Track corners are to be mitred.

6.  PARTS:  There are 16 parts on the board:
             Discretes                :  13
             Other                    :  3

7.  PADS:  There are 39 pads on the top layer and 39 pads on
    the bottom layer.  DIP pads are 1.8288 mm in diameter.  SMD
    pads are 0. mm wide.

8.  VIA PADS:  Via pads are 1.524 mm  wide.

9.  LENGTH MINIMIZATION:  Most nets are to be Length Minimized
    using MIN DIST.

10. TRACKS:  The primary track width is 0.9999 mm:
             100.000% of etch has width 0.9999 mm

11. SPACE:  The space clearance will be 0.9999 mm.

12. DENSITY:  The board area is 39.536 sq.in..  There are
    2 Equivalent 16 pin DIPs on the board.  The density is
    16.22  sq. mm per Equivalent 16 pin DIPs.

13. ROUTING PREDICTION:  The probability of routing to 100%
    completion is 100.0%.

14. TIME PREDICTION:  The board will be routed in approximately 
    0 hours and 2 minutes.

15. MEMORY PREDICTION:  The board will need approximately 
    0 MB.
